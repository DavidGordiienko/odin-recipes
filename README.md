# odin-recipes
A basic project to test the skills I learned from The Odin Project. A simple website with some recipes. All recipes sourced from allrecipes.com. From this project, I got some practice using images, headings, relative links, ordered lists, and unordered lists. I also learned the basics of Git and GitHub.
