    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These garlic mashed potatoes are rich and very tasty! For a creamier texture, use heavy cream in
        place of the milk. These are also terrific topped with sesame seeds or green onions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

            2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>5 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
